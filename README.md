# Rosmarin.ts

Rosmarin.ts is a framework to develop RESTful APIs with Node.js. There are a lot of npm packages that claim to allow 
developers to build RESTful APIs. However, these often ignore some fundamental conditions of REST. 
Especially the hypermedia constraint is always ignored. The goal of this framework is to provide Node.js developers a tool
to effectively build REST APIs. In addition, care is taken to have as few dependencies as possible in the project.
