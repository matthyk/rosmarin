# Rosmarin.ts

Rosmarin.ts is a framework to develop RESTful APIs with Node.js. There are a lot of npm packages that claim to allow 
developers to build RESTful APIs. However, these often ignore some fundamental conditions of REST. 
Especially the hypermedia constraint is always ignored. The goal of this framework is to provide Node.js developers a tool
to effectively build REST APIs. In addition, care is taken to have as few dependencies as possible in the project. \
This framework is heavily inspired by Norbury. Nobury is part of the research project GeMARA of the App.lab of the 
University of Applied Sciences WÃ¼rzburg-Schweinfurt, 
which focuses on the automatic generation of REST APIs.
